## Process equations {-}
### Population dynamics {-}
The order of processes in an annual cycle follow

1. recruitment and release of tagged fish (we apply initial tag induced mortality here),
2. total mortality and ageing,
3. markovian movement
4. annual tag shedding (applied as a mortality process),



Before movement, the partition is updated following 
\begin{align*}
N_{a,r,y,s} = 
\begin{cases}
R_{r,y} 0.5, & a = a_1\\
N_{a - 1,r,y - 1,s} \exp\bigg( -Z_{a - 1,r, y - 1,s} \bigg), & a_1 < a < a_+\\
N_{a - 1,r,y - 1,s} \exp\bigg( -Z_{a - 1,r, y - 1,s} \bigg) + N_{a,r,y - 1,s} \exp\bigg( -Z_{a,r, y - 1,s} \bigg), &  a = a_+
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

and movement is then applied

\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{N}'_{a,y,s} = \boldsymbol{N}_{a,y,s} \boldsymbol{M} \ \ \forall \ a
\end{equation*}

where, \(\boldsymbol{N}'_{a,y,s} = (N'_{a,1,y,s}, \dots, N'_{a,n_r,y,s})\) denotes the numbers for age \(a\) across all regions after movement and \(\boldsymbol{M}\) is an \(n_r \times n_r\) movement matrix, which will move age cohort \(a\) among the regions based on the movement matrix.


### Initialisation {-}
An equilibrium age structure is derived by iterating the annual cycle is run \(n_a - 1\) times (i.e., to populate all age cohorts prior to the plus group). Then, iterate the annual cycle one more time and calculate the number of individuals that moved into each regions plus age cohort, denoted by \(c^r_{a+}\). This will be the result of ageing, mortality and movement. The equilibrium plus group for region \(r\) is then calculated as

\[
N_{a+, r} = N_{a+ - 1, r} \frac{1}{1 - c^r_{a+}}  \  .
\]

After the equilibrium age-structure is calculated, there is an option to estimate global or region specific deviations to allow the model to start with a non-equilibrium age-structure

\[
N_{a, r} = N_{a, r} e^{\epsilon_a} \ \ \forall \ a \ r \ .
\]
To help with estimation there is a penalty on \(\epsilon_a\) that assumes a central tendancy of zero with an estimable variance parameter (\(\sigma_{\epsilon}^2\)). 
\[
\epsilon_a \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\epsilon})
\]

In general these parameters can be highly uncertain. The variance on these deviation parameters is often fixed at a low value which requires a strong signal in the data to deviate away from the initial equilibrium age-structure.


### Growth {-}

Empirical length at age matrices are supplied for all years where sufficient age-length data was available and growth was assumed the same across all regions. Mean weight at age was calculated using an allometric length weight relationship with time and space invariant parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)

\[
\bar{w}_{a,y} = \alpha \bar{l}_{a,y}^{\beta} 
\]

**TODO** add the adjustment for lognormal distribution as in Casal2.

### Recruitment {-}
How to spatially apportion recruits in a way that is consistent with the data and isn't confounded with movement of young fish? There are two considerations, firstly looking at the AF and LFs there are regions that seem to have more young fish than others (link to figure and describe). However, there is very little information on spawning grounds and behavior. This coupled with a complex early life history make it difficult to a priori set regional apportionment of recruits, which would be ideal, an alternative is to estimate these as free parameters. This may introduce confounding when we start estimating movement which is believed to be ontogenetic.

### Fishing mortality {-}
When the hybrid \(F\) method is assumed, tagged fish were not included when internally solving the fishing mortality nuisance parameters. The ratio of tagged to untagged numbers of fish in the partition in any year was assumed to be small enough not to effect \(F\) estimates. However, tagged fish were included when the model calculates predicted catch-at-age/length and catch for a fleet. This decision was made to reduce the computational overhead this would require to implement. When \(F\) parameters are estimated as free parameters, then this is not a problem and \(F\) will be applied to both tagged and untagged fish.


### Tag release events {-}

Tags release event denoted by the index \(k\) have an implied region \(r\) and year \(y\) dimension. Each tag release event has known sex and age frequency at release. This is derived using the age-length key from the survey. Tagged fish from release event \(k\) are denoted in the partition by \(N^k_{a,r,y,s}\), and are tracked for \(n_{T}\) years before migrating into a pooled tag group, at which point we loose release-event information because we loose the year information but we do maintain its region of release. At present, tagged fish are assumed to take on the exact same population processes as the untagged elements of the partition.


Most of the tagged fish in the available have unknown sex. Sex disaggregated age-frequencies were derived using an ALK that was disaggregrated by sex in the age dimension but sex aggregated in the length dimension. This meant when we multiplied an unsexed length frequency through this ALK we obtained sex disaggregated age frequency. The negative of this approach is a tagged fish that would have an exact age, sex and length will be represented in the model as a fraction of a fish across multiple ages and sexes.


Age length keys were not available in all years when tagged fish were released, particularly in the early period. Tag release age frequencies before 1981 were based on age-length keys pooled over years 1981, 1985 and 1987. After that period, if an age-length key was not available we used the age length key from the closest year that has an age-length key. (**How can we explore uncertainty in this input?** re-run the model with numbers at age and length from bootstrapping age-length keys?)


## Observation equations {-}

There are five observation types available in the `TagIntegrated` model

- Relative indices of abundance from the longline survey
- Age composition disaggregated by sex for the fixed gear fishery and longline survey
- Length composition disaggregated by sex for the trawl and early period of the fixed gear fishery 
- Annual observed catch by fishery
- Tag recoveries from the fixed gear fishery

### Catch at age {-}
Fishery dependent catch at age observations are available for the fixed gear fishery, but are also needed to calculate catch at length observations for the trawl fishery. Catch at age for fishery \(g\) is denoted by \({C}^g_{a,r,y,s}\) and model fitted values are calculated following

\begin{equation} 
  {C}^g_{a,r,y,s} = \frac{F^g_{a,r,y,s}}{Z_{a,r,y,s}}   N_{a,r,y,s} \left(1 - S_{a,r,y,s} \right)
\end{equation} 

Observed values were proportions with respect to age and sex, final model fitted proportions were
\[
{P}^g_{a,r,y,s} = \frac{{C}^g_{a,r,y,s}}{\sum_a \sum_s {C}^g_{a,r,y,s}},
\]

if the multinomial distribution is assumed

\[
\boldsymbol{X}^g_{r,y} \sim \text{Multinomial}\left(\boldsymbol{\widehat{P}}^g_{r,y}\right)
\]

where, \(\boldsymbol{X}^g_{r,y} = \boldsymbol{P}^g_{r,y}N^{eff}_{r,y}\) and \(\boldsymbol{P}^g_{r,y}\) is the observed proportions, \(N^{eff}_{r,y}\) is the effective sample size and \(\boldsymbol{P}^g_{r,y} = (P^g_{1,r,y,1}, \dots, P^g_{a_+,r,y,1}, P^g_{1,r,y,2}, \dots, P^g_{a_+,r,y,2})\) is the vector of observed proportions across all ages and sexs in year \(y\) and region \(r\), and \(\boldsymbol{\widehat{P}}^g_{r,y}\) is the model fitted values which have the same dimension (\(\sum_a \sum_s \widehat{P}^g_{a,r,y,s} = 1\)).


### Catch at length {-}
Catch at length observations are available for the trawl fishery. Model fitted values are derived by multiplying the catch at age (see above) by an age-length transition matrix denoted by \(\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s}\) (dimensions of \(\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s}\) are \(n_a \ \times \ n_l\) and its rows must sum to 1),

\begin{equation} 
  \widehat{\boldsymbol{Cl}}^g_{r,y,s} =  \left(\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s} \right)^T \ \times \ \widehat{\boldsymbol{C}}^g_{r,y,s}
\end{equation} 
where, \(\widehat{\boldsymbol{C}}^g_{r,y,s}\) is a column vector of catch at age (dimension \(n_a \ \times \ 1\)) at the beginning of year \(y\) in region \(r\) for sex \(s\), and \(\widehat{\boldsymbol{Cl}}^g_{r,y,s} \) is a column vector of catch at length (dimension \(n_l \ \times \ 1\)).


### Proportions at age {-}
Survey age composition data denoted by \({N}^s_{a,r,y,s}\) is available for the longline survey where model fitted numbers are derived as,

\begin{equation} 
  \widehat{N}^s_{a,r,y,s} = N_{a,r,y,s} \left(1 - \exp^{\delta_y Z_{a,r,y,s}}\right)S^s_{y,r,a,s}
\end{equation} 
where, \(\delta_y \in (0,1)\) is the proportion of time in the year that the observation occurs during year \(y\) and \(S^s_{y,r,a,s}\) is the survey selectivity.


### Relative abundance indices {-}
\begin{equation} 
  \widehat{I}^s_{r,y} = \sum_s\sum_a \widehat{N}^s_{a,r,y,s} \bar{w}_{a,y,s}
\end{equation} 
where, \(\bar{w}_{a,y,s}\) is mean weight at age, this can be omitted if the observation is in numbers i.e., abundance instead of biomass.

### Tag recovery observations {-}

When tagged fish are released in to the model partition they are tracked by the tag release event index denoted by \(k\) for \(n_{T}\) years after release. Due to tags being predominately recovered by the fixed gear fishery, all recoveries are assumed from the fixed gear fishery. A tag recovery observation will depend on if it is release conditioned or recapture conditioned. If tag-observations are release conditioned (the default) then for each release event there is a maximum of \(n_{T} \times n_r + 1\) recovery possibilities, assuming the fixed gear fishery operates in all regions and all years we tracked the release event for. The plus one is for the not-recovered event, although it is not clear to me how this is different from a zero recovery event? (ask Dan). Let \(m\) index a recovery event for a given release event and let \(n_{m|k} = n_{T} \times n_r + 1\) where \(n_{m|k}\) is the number of recovery events for release event \(k\). Let \(N^k_{m}\) denote the number of tag-recoveries for a given release and recovery combination, and \(\boldsymbol{N^k} = (N^k_{1}, N^k_{2}, \dots, N^k_{n_{m|k}})^T\) represents a vector of all possible observed recoveries for release event \(k\). Model fitted values for \(N^k_{m}\) are calculated as

\[
\widehat{N}^k_{m} =  \sum_a \sum_s N^k_{a,r,y,s} \frac{F^{LL}_{a,r,y,s}}{Z_{a,r,y,s}} (1 - e^{-Z_{a,r,y,s}})\delta_y \ \ y,r \in m|k
\]
where, \(N^k_{a,r,y,s}\) is the number of tagged fish alive from tag-release event \(k\), and \(\delta_y\) is the reporting rate in year \(y\).

There are three likelihoods used in the literature for tag-recoveries,

- The Poisson (`tag_likelihood = 0`)
\[
N^k_{m} \sim \mathcal{Poisson}(\widehat{N}^k_{m})
\]
- The Negative Binomial (`tag_likelihood = 1`)
\[
N^k_{m} \sim \mathcal{NB}(\widehat{N}^k_{m}, \hat{\phi})
\]
where, \(\hat{\phi}\) is the estimable dispersion parameter
- Multinomial (Not implemented)
\[
\boldsymbol{N^k}  \sim \text{Multinomial}\left(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}^k, \text{Neff}^k\right)
\]
All the recovery states include all regions, and years of recoveries including the non recaptured, where, \(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}^k = (\hat{\theta}^k_1, \hat{\theta}^k_2\dots, \hat{\theta}^k_{n_{m|k}})\) is the proportions of all recovery states [@vincent2020parameter; @goethel2014demonstration], with

\begin{equation}
\hat{\theta}^{k}_{m} = \frac{\widehat{N}^k_{m}}{\sum_m \widehat{N}^k_{m}}
\end{equation}


For recapture conditioned tag-recovery observations, we calculate the probability of capture a fish at time \(t\) being released in region \(r\) and recovered in region \(r'\). This was explored by @mcgarvey2002estimating. In this study they show how many of the terms can be dropped when describing the probability of that recovery event. The term \(S_i[a_t, a_m]\) represents the probability of a tagged individual tagged at \(a_t\) surviving until \(a_m\). In our model this surviorship will be regional specific, i.e., fish in certain regions will be exposed to higher fishing mortality rates than other regions over time.

Here, model predicted recaptures are recapture conditioned, which means the predicted proportions are year specific, and represent the proportion of recaptures in each region, \(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}^k_y = (\hat{\theta}^{k}_{y,1},\dots, \hat{\theta}^k_{y,n_r})'\)
\begin{equation}
\hat{\theta}^{k}_{y,r} = \frac{\widehat{N}^k_{r,y}}{\sum_r\widehat{N}^k_{r,y}}
\end{equation}




- How to deal with the high number of zeros in \(\boldsymbol{N^k}\) zero inflated?




These are derived for each recovery event (also year and region specific) denoted by the index \(m\) and tag-release event by using the age-length key that was used to release each recovered fish to obtain an sex specific age-frequency. This age-frequency is then aged by the number of years this tag-recovery event was at liberty to derive observed tag-recoveries by age and sex.

This assumes the age-length conversion between releases and recoveries is consistent and allows us to use recovered fish with no length or sex recorded, but has the down side as mentioned earlier in the tag release section of smearing a single recovered fish across multiple age bins and sexes. However, it does mitigate the problem of going backwards and forwards through the age-length transition matrix, which appears to be more problematic.




- Multinomial (Not implemented)
\[
{N}^k_{r,y} \sim \text{Multinomial}\left(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}^k_y, \text{Neff}^k_y\right)
\]
Here, model predicted recaptures are recapture conditioned, which means the predicted proportions are year specific, and represent the proportion of recaptures in each region, \(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}^k_y = (\hat{\theta}^{k}_{y,1},\dots, \hat{\theta}^k_{y,n_r})'\)
\begin{equation}
\hat{\theta}^{k}_{y,r} = \frac{\widehat{N}^k_{r,y}}{\sum_r\widehat{N}^k_{r,y}}
\end{equation}

Release conditioned are defined as the proportion of recaptures over all states denoted as \(i\), for each release event. All the states, include all regions, and years of recoveries including the non recaptured, where, \(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}^k = (\hat{\theta}^k_i, \hat{\theta}^k_2\dots, \hat{\theta}^k_{n_i}) = (\hat{\theta}^k_{1,1}, \hat{\theta}^k_{1,2}, \hat{\theta}^k_{2,2}, \dots, \hat{\theta}^k_{n_y,n_r}, \hat{\theta}^k_{NR})\) is the proportions of all states [@vincent2020parameter; @goethel2014demonstration], with

\begin{equation}
\hat{\theta}^{k}_{i} = \frac{\widehat{N}^k_{i}}{\sum_i \widehat{N}^k_{i}}
\end{equation}


## Likelihood formulations {-}

### Multinomial {-}

This likelihood has no estimable parameters

\[
\boldsymbol{X} \sim \text{Multinomial}\left(\boldsymbol{\widehat{P}}\right)
\]

To avoid \(\widehat{P}_i = 0\), in which case the multinomial can be undefined if \(X_i = 0\) all values of \(\widehat{P}_i\) are run through a `posfun` function which adds a small constant and penalty to the likelihood. See this TMB issue [here](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/issues/7) or Ben Bolker's write up found [here](https://github.com/bbolker/bbmisc/blob/master/posfun.pdf).


### Dirichlet-Multinomial {-}
The Dirichlet multinomial distribution used for composition data, when

- \((p_1,\dots,p_k) \sim \mathrm{Dirichlet}(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k)\) and 
- \((x_1,\dots,x_k) \sim \mathrm{Multinomial}(n, p_1,\dots,p_k)\), then 
- \((x_1,\dots,x_k) \sim \mathrm{DirichletMultinomial(n, \alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k)}\).

The probability density function follows
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \frac{\left(n!\right)\Gamma\left(\sum \alpha_k\right)}{\Gamma\left(n+\sum \alpha_k\right)}\prod_{k=1}^K\frac{\Gamma(x_{k}+\alpha_{k})} {\left(x_{k}!\right)\Gamma(\alpha_{k})}
\end{equation}

In the paper by @thorson2017model, the Dirichlet multinomial with observed proportions denoted by \(\tilde{\pi}\) fitted proportions \(\pi\) and over dispersion parameter \(\beta\) and effective sample size \(n_{eff}\). This relates to the classic parametersiation above with \(x_k = \tilde{\pi}_k n_{eff}\), \(\alpha_k = \beta \pi_k\) and \(n = n_{eff}\). When this likelihood is implemented it has an estimable parameter \(\theta = \beta/n_{eff}\).


When simulating from this distribution we first simulate the dirichlet variable, using independent gamma draws (normalised), with shape parameter set as the fitted proportion. Then draw from the multinomial with expected composition based on the dirichlet draw.
