# `TagIntegrated` `data` and `parameter` descriptions {-}

Users need to population a `data` and `parameters` named list object that is then passed to TMB's `MakeADFun`. These sections outline the elements and corresponding dimensions of both `data` and `parameters`.


## `data` {-}

- `ages` vector of ages. Length `n_ages`
- `years` vector of years from start year to current year. length `n_years`
- `length_bins` vector of length bin midpoints. length. `n_length_bins`
- `n_projections_years` integer of future years to project the model `n_projyears = n_years + n_projections_years`
- `do_projection` integer 0 means don't do projection 1 does a stochastic projection
- `n_regions` integer needs to be greater than 1
- `global_rec_devs` integer 1 means all regions share the same recruitment deviations. 0 means they have separate global recruitment deviations. This will effect the dimensions of the parameter `ln_rec_dev`
- `n_init_rec_devs` number of initial n_age_deviations (`parameter$ln_init_rec_dev`) to multiply against the initial numbers at age to have non equilibrium initial age-structure. A value of zero will **not** apply these initial devs and expects `parameter$ln_init_rec_dev` to have length 1.
