# `Assessment` `data` and `parameter` descriptions {-}

Users need to population a named list containing `data` inputs and a named list specifying starting values for estimable `parameters` which are both passed to TMB's `MakeADFun` function. This section outlines the elements and corresponding dimensions of both `data` and `parameters`.


## `data` {-}

- `ages` vector of ages. Length `n_ages`
- `years` vector of years from start year to current year. length `n_years`
- `length_bins` vector of length bin midpoints. length. `n_length_bins`
- `n_projections_years` integer of future years to project the model `n_projyears = n_years + n_projections_years`
- `do_projection` integer 0 means don't do projection 1 does a stochastic projection (**should be turned off during estimation**)
- `n_init_rec_devs` number of initial n_age_deviations (`parameter$ln_init_rec_dev`) to multiply against the initial numbers at age to have non equilibrium initial age-structure. A value of zero will **not** apply these initial devs and expects `parameter$ln_init_rec_dev` to have length 1. These deviations are applied equally to both male and female.
- `M` Natural mortality array with dimensions `n_ages` \(\times\) `n_projyears`
- `maturity` proportion mature array with dimensions `n_ages` \(\times\) `n_projyears`
- `male_mean_weight_by_age` male mean weight at age array with dimensions `n_ages` \(\times\) `n_projyears`. Units are in kgs, this is because we track millions of fish in the partition, so any weight calculation is in kilo tonnes
- `female_mean_weight_by_age` female mean weight at age array with dimensions `n_ages` \(\times\) `n_projyears`. Units are in kgs, this is because we track millions of fish in the partition, so any weight calculation is in kilo tonnes
- `male_age_length_transition` male age-length transtion matrix for each year. An array with dimensions `n_ages` \(\times\)`n_length_bins` \(\times\) `n_projyears`
- `female_age_length_transition` female age-length transtion matrix for each year. An array with dimensions `n_ages` \(\times\)`n_length_bins` \(\times\) `n_projyears`
