R query methods. You can also use help(package = \"SpatialSablefishAssessment\") to get a list of functions available in this package. Most of the functions will ask for an optional input parameter called region_key which will add a label for regions. This is a data.frame which is shown in the following code chunk. Note how the column TMB_ndx is an index made for C++ syntax not R i.e., it starts at 0 not 1. region_key = data.frame(area = c(&quot;BS&quot;,&quot;AI&quot;,&quot;WGOA&quot;,&quot;CGOA&quot;,&quot;EGOA&quot;), TMB_ndx = c(0:4)) region_key ## area TMB_ndx ## 1 BS 0 ## 2 AI 1 ## 3 WGOA 2 ## 4 CGOA 3 ## 5 EGOA 4 Validate functions validate_input_data_and_parameters This should always be run on data and parameters applying TMB::MakeADFun.

Projection/Reference point functions setup_proj_data this function will take an estimation model and create a data list that when built with TMB::MakeADFun creates a model that will projections for a user defined number of projection years. find_apportioned_fref this will find a single F assuming future deterministic recruitment that achieves some specified target global percent \\(B_{0}\\). Users must specify how much of that sinlge F is allocated to each fishery in each region. find_regional_fref this will attempt to find an F for each region and fishery assuming future deterministic (mean) recruitment that achieves some specified target percent \\(B_{0}\\) in each region. Worth checking the output for this function when there is movement among areas. This connectivity assumption can result in difficult optimisation. Model comparison functions Often you will run multiple models to explore alternative assumptions and hypothesis. There are a range of function available for extracting output convenient for plotting and summarizing. In order to use the following functions you need to create a list containing multiple runs e.g. multi_runs &lt;- list() multi_runs[[1]] &lt;- low_M_model$report() multi_runs[[2]] &lt;- high_M_model$report() run_labels = c(&quot;M = 0.08&quot;, &quot;M = 0.2&quot;) ssb_df = get_multiple_ssbs(mle_ls = multi_runs, run_labels = run_labels) get_multiple_ssbs get multiple models SSBs get_multiple_catch_fits Get multiple models catch fits get_multiple_nlls get multiple models negative log-likelihood Distribution functions ddirichmult Dirichlet-multinomial pdf function dmultinom_upd Multinomial pdf function, which is the same as TMB’s.

Data grooming functions These aren’t related to the model per se. These are useful when grooming raw data sets that are ultimately used as inputs into the model. record_grooming_rule this will create a table of how much catch and how many records are removed from applying some data grooming rules apply_grooming_rule equivalent to the subset function Auxillary functions VAlignPlots a plotting function that joins multiple ggplots into a single panel with aligned legends and extents "],["how-to-use-spatialsablefishassessment.html", "How to use SpatialSablefishAssessment Configuring and checking model inputs (data and parameters) Optimisation Model Summary", " How to use SpatialSablefishAssessment Configuring and checking model inputs (data and parameters) This package contains TMB models and summarizing and plotting functions for a spatial model used in sablefish research. Users are responsible for configuring the data and parameter structures that are passed to the TMB MakeADFun function which compiles the model. The best place to look for what dimensions and names of expected elements for data and parameter it is best to look at an example or the source code for the model (see here).

All functions should be documented and queried using the usual R ? method plot_input_observations plot_input_catches plot_mean_weight plot_age_length_matrix Once you have checked the data and parameter objects you can build the TMB model following, my_model = TMB::MakeADFun(data = data, parameters = parameters, DLL = &quot;SpatialSablefishAssessment_TMBExports&quot;, silent = T) Simple sanity checks It is possible to configure a model that has zero gradients for parameters, and you want to check this is not the case using the check_gradients(my_model) Check the likelihoods are all finite.

Initialisation An equilibrium age structure is derived by iterating the annual cycle is run \\(n_a - 1\\) times (i.e., to populate all age cohorts prior to the plus group). Then, iterate the annual cycle one more time and calculate the number of individuals that moved into each regions plus age cohort, denoted by \\(c^r_{a+}\\). This will be the result of ageing, mortality and movement. The equilibrium plus group for region \\(r\\) is then calculated as \\[ N_{a+, r} = N_{a+ - 1, r} \\frac{1}{1 - c^r_{a+}} \\ . \\] After the equilibrium age-structure is calculated, there is an option to estimate global or region specific deviations to allow the model to start with a non-equilibrium age-structure \\[ N_{a, r} = N_{a, r} e^{\\epsilon_a} \\ \\ \\forall \\ a \\ r \\ . \\] To help with estimation there is a penalty on \\(\\epsilon_a\\) that assumes a central tendancy of zero with an estimable variance parameter (\\(\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2\\)). \\[ \\epsilon_a \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{\\epsilon}) \\] In general these parameters can be highly uncertain. The variance on these deviation parameters is often fixed at a low value which requires a strong signal in the data to deviate away from the initial equilibrium age-structure. You can also apply/estimate additional fishing mortality during the initial equilibrium calculation denoted by \\(F^{init}_{a,s}\\) for age \\(a\\) and sex \\(s\\). If F_method = 0 then \\[ F^{init}_{a,s} = F^{fixed} S_{a,s}^{fixed} p_{hist} \\] where, \\(F^{fixed}\\) is the average annual fishing mortality for the fixed gear (ln_fixed_F_avg), \\(S_{a,s}^{fixed}\\) is the fixed gear selectivity in the first time-block and \\(p_{hist}\\) is an input value that specifies the proportion of average longline fishing mortality to apply during initialisation. If F_method = 1 then \\[ F^{init} = \\widehat{F}^{init}S_{a,s}^{fixed} p_{hist} \\] where, \\(\\widehat{F}^{init}\\) is the estimable parameter ln_init_F_avg. It is advised to set \\(p_{hist} = 1.0\\) so that the estimated parameter has a natural interpretation. There are two initial biomass quantities that are reported, these are Bzero and Binit. Bzero is the spawning biomass from a population that has been exposed to natural mortality, recruitment (R0), and movement only. Binit is the spawning biomass from a population that has been exposed to natural mortality and initial fishing mortality (\\(F^{init}\\)), recruitment (R0), and movement. Growth Empirical length at age matrices are supplied for all years where sufficient age-length data was available and growth was assumed the same across all regions. Mean weight at age is also an user input. Growth cannot vary across regions in the current models, so users must supply length at age matrices and weight at age vectors for each year, age and sex in the model. Recruitment How to spatially apportion recruits in a way that is consistent with the data and isn’t confounded with movement of young fish? There are two considerations, firstly looking at the AF and LFs there are regions that seem to have more young fish than others (link to figure and describe). However, there is very little information on spawning grounds and behavior. This coupled with a complex early life history make it difficult to a priori set regional apportionment of recruits, which would be ideal, an alternative is to estimate these as free parameters. This may introduce confounding when we start estimating movement which is believed to be ontogenetic. Terminology regarding recruitment and spatial population structures can be ambiguous and confusing. There is a fair bit of literature describing and comparing metapopulations, panmictic populations and spatially heterogeneous populations. I believe this model can represent the later two A metapopulation implies there is some natal identifiability when fish are mixing which this model doesn’t do. However, this would only be advantageous when there is some sort of natal dynamic e.g. natal homing or natal productivity difference such as growth. Neither of these are really evident in the observed data for sablefish and so having a natal attribute in the partition doesn’t make much sense. Spawning biomass Spawning biomass is based on mature female weight. SSB in a given year and region is calculated as, \\[ SSB_{y,r} \\sum\\limits_a N_{a,s = 2, r, y} S^{mat}_{a,y} \\bar{w}_{a,s = 2, y} \\] where, \\(s = 2\\) denotes the female sex, \\(S^{mat}_{a,y}\\) is the maturity at age and \\(\\bar{w}_{a,s = 2, y}\\) is female mean weight at age Fishing mortality When the hybrid \\(F\\) method is assumed, tagged fish were not included when internally solving the fishing mortality nuisance parameters. The ratio of tagged to untagged numbers of fish in the partition in any year was assumed to be small enough not to effect \\(F\\) estimates. However, tagged fish were included when the model calculates predicted catch-at-age/length and catch for a fleet. This decision was made to reduce the computational overhead this would require to implement. When \\(F\\) parameters are estimated as free parameters, then this is not a problem and \\(F\\) will be applied to both tagged and untagged fish. Tag release events Tags release event denoted by the index \\(k\\) have an implied region \\(r\\) and year \\(y\\) dimension. Each tag release event has known sex and age frequency at release. Often tagging data has only length at release information, we have used age-length keys to convert numbers at length of release to numbers at age and sex at release that are then input into the model (data$male_tagged_cohorts_by_age and data$female_tagged_cohorts_by_age). Tagged fish from release event \\(k\\) are denoted in the partition by \\(N^k_{a,r,y,s}\\), and are tracked for \\(n_{T}\\) (data$n_years_to_retain_tagged_cohorts_for) years before migrating into an accumulation tag group, at which point we loose release-year information but do maintain release region. At present, tagged fish are assumed to take on the exact same population processes as the untagged elements of the partition i.e., no mixing periods. Something to consider, given there is uncertainty in the age-length key method, when converting numbers at length to numbers at age and sex and the numbers of tag-releases are assumed known without error. Consider rerunning the model with bootstrapped tag releases from bootstrapped age-length keys. This will give you an indication of the uncertainty the model has to this input assumption. Selectivities Describe the functional forms available in the models. The selectivity component is quite modular and you can easily add a new selectivity function in the source code here. There are three selectivities in the model one for the survey and two for the fisheries. Selectivities types are set by the model data objects ending with sel_type e.g., fixed_sel_type, trwl_sel_type and srv_dom_ll_sel_type. These objects are vectors each element defines a selectivity type that is applied in a time-block. The time-block is defined by the corresponding sel_by_year_indicator objects. The following is an example of how to specify and interpret these containers. Say data$years = c(1990, 1991, 1992, 1993) and we were not interested in doing projections (require more elements in sel_by_year_indicator objects). Say we wanted to have 1990 and 1991 have one logistic selectivity and then 1992 and 1993 to have seperate logistic selectivity for the fixed gear fishery, you would specify the containers as data$fixed_sel_type = c(0, 0) data$fixed_sel_by_year_indicator = c(0, 0, 1, 1) this points each model year to a selectivity in data$fixed_sel_type Selectivity types are 0 Logistic \\[ S(a | \\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\theta_2 \\times (a - \\theta_1)} \\] 1 Double normal - Punt et. al 1996 gamma parameterization (that is a comment from the ADMB assessment code) \\[ S(a | \\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\frac{a}{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_1/0.5\\sqrt{\\theta_1^2 + 4\\theta_2^2}} exp\\left(\\frac{\\theta_1 - a}{0.5 \\left( \\sqrt{\\theta_1^2 + 4\\theta_2^2} - \\theta_1 \\right)} \\right) \\] 2 power function (Be careful with this selectivity, if your min age is not = 1. Then I don’t think you will end up with a max selectivity value of 1) \\[ S(a | \\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{a ^{\\theta_1}} \\] 3 Alternative logistic \\[ S(a | \\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\frac{1}{1 + 19^{(\\theta_1 - a) / \\theta_2}} \\] Observation equations There are five observation types available in the TagIntegrated model Relative indices of abundance from a longline survey (its called longline survey but could be any survey) Age composition disaggregated by sex for the fixed gear fishery and longline survey Length composition disaggregated by sex for the trawl and fixed gear fishery Annual observed catch by fishery Tag recoveries from the fixed gear fishery Catch at age Fishery dependent catch at age observations are available for the fixed gear fishery, but are also needed to calculate catch at length observations for the trawl fishery. Catch at age for fishery \\(g\\) is denoted by \\({C}^g_{a,r,y,s}\\) and model fitted values are calculated following \\[\\begin{equation} {C}^g_{a,r,y,s} = \\frac{F^g_{a,r,y,s}}{Z_{a,r,y,s}} N_{a,r,y,s} \\left(1 - S_{a,r,y,s} \\right) \\end{equation}\\] Observed values were proportions with respect to age and sex, final model fitted proportions were \\[ {P}^g_{a,r,y,s} = \\frac{{C}^g_{a,r,y,s}}{\\sum_a \\sum_s {C}^g_{a,r,y,s}}, \\] if the multinomial distribution is assumed \\[ \\boldsymbol{X}^g_{r,y} \\sim \\text{Multinomial}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\widehat{P}}^g_{r,y}\\right) \\] where, \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^g_{r,y} = \\boldsymbol{P}^g_{r,y}N^{eff}_{r,y}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{P}^g_{r,y}\\) is the observed proportions, \\(N^{eff}_{r,y}\\) is the effective sample size and \\(\\boldsymbol{P}^g_{r,y} = (P^g_{1,r,y,1}, \\dots, P^g_{a_+,r,y,1}, P^g_{1,r,y,2}, \\dots, P^g_{a_+,r,y,2})\\) is the vector of observed proportions across all ages and sexs in year \\(y\\) and region \\(r\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\widehat{P}}^g_{r,y}\\) is the model fitted values which have the same dimension (\\(\\sum_a \\sum_s \\widehat{P}^g_{a,r,y,s} = 1\\)). Catch at length Catch at length observations are available for the trawl fishery. Model fitted values are derived by multiplying the catch at age (see above) by an age-length transition matrix denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s}\\) (dimensions of \\(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s}\\) are \\(n_a \\ \\times \\ n_l\\) and its rows must sum to 1), \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{Cl}}^g_{r,y,s} = \\left(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s} \\right)^T \\ \\times \\ \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{C}}^g_{r,y,s} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{C}}^g_{r,y,s}\\) is a column vector of catch at age (dimension \\(n_a \\ \\times \\ 1\\)) at the beginning of year \\(y\\) in region \\(r\\) for sex \\(s\\), and \\(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{Cl}}^g_{r,y,s}\\) is a column vector of catch at length (dimension \\(n_l \\ \\times \\ 1\\)). Proportions at age Survey age composition data denoted by \\({N}^s_{a,r,y,s}\\) is available for the longline survey where model fitted numbers are derived as, \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{N}^s_{a,r,y,s} = N_{a,r,y,s} \\left(1 - \\exp^{\\delta_y Z_{a,r,y,s}}\\right)S^s_{y,r,a,s} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\delta_y \\in (0,1)\\) is the proportion of time in the year that the observation occurs during year \\(y\\) and \\(S^s_{y,r,a,s}\\) is the survey selectivity. Relative abundance indices \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{I}^s_{r,y} = \\sum_s\\sum_a \\widehat{N}^s_{a,r,y,s} \\bar{w}_{a,y,s} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\bar{w}_{a,y,s}\\) is mean weight at age, this can be omitted if the observation is in numbers i.e., abundance instead of biomass using data$srv_dom_ll_obs_is_abundance = 1. There are currently two likelihoods available for this observation if data$srv_dom_ll_bio_comp_likelihood == 0 \\[ ll_{r,y} = \\frac{\\left( \\log {I}^s_{r,y} + 0.0001 - \\log \\widehat{I}^s_{r,y} + 0.0001 \\right)^2}{2 \\left( SE[{I}^s_{r,y}] / {I}^s_{r,y} \\right)} \\] if data$srv_dom_ll_bio_comp_likelihood == 1 \\[ ll_{r,y} = \\frac{1}{{I}^s_{r,y} SE[{I}^s_{r,y}] \\sqrt{ 2\\pi}} \\exp \\left( - \\frac{ \\left(\\log {I}^s_{r,y} - \\log \\widehat{I}^s_{r,y} - 0.5SE[{I}^s_{r,y}]^2\\right)^2}{2 SE[{I}^s_{r,y}]^2}\\right) \\] The catchability coefficient can also be calculated as a nuisance parameter instead of a free estimable parameter using the input data$q_is_nuisance = 1. This will solve the value for q in each region conditional on the other input free parameters. If the abundance or biomass observation is assumed to be lognormally distributed, then we can algebraically solve for the catchability coefficient. For simplicity in the following equations we use \\(E_i\\) to denote the model expected value \\(O_i\\) to denote the observed value and \\(\\sigma_i\\) to denote the standard error for element \\(i\\) of a series. In this case a time-series is within each region. So we will calculate a nuisance q for each region. Technically, this derivation is only correct when data$srv_dom_ll_bio_comp_likelihood == 1 however, it will be considered an approximation for the other likelihood. Assuming a specific element contributes to the negative log likelihood in the following manor, \\[ -ll = \\sum_i log (\\sigma_i) + 0.5\\sum_i \\bigg(\\frac{log(O_i) - log(qE_i) + 0.5\\sigma_i^2}{\\sigma_i} \\bigg)^2 \\ , \\] then, if you differentiate this term with respect to \\(q\\) you get \\[ \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial q}(-ll) = \\frac{-1}{q} \\sum_i\\bigg( \\frac{log(O_i/E_i) - log(q) + 0.5\\sigma_i^2}{\\sigma_i^2}\\bigg) \\, \\] if you solve for when the derivative is zero (MLE estimate) then you obtain the following result \\[ \\hat q = exp\\frac{0.5n + S_3}{S_4} \\, \\] where \\(S_3 = \\sum_i (log(O_i /E_I)/\\sigma_i^2)\\) and \\(S_4 = \\sum_i(1/\\sigma_i^2)\\). \\(E_i\\) in the initial calculation is derived assuming a \\(q = 1\\), before \\(\\hat q\\) is calculated. Tag recovery observations When tagged fish are released in to the model partition they are tracked by the tag release event index denoted by \\(k\\) for \\(n_{T}\\) years after release. Due to tags being predominately recovered by the fixed gear fishery, all recoveries are assumed from the fixed gear fishery. A tag recovery observation will depend on if it is release conditioned or recapture conditioned. If tag-observations are release conditioned (the default) then for each release event there is a maximum of \\(n_{T} \\times n_r + 1\\) recovery possibilities, assuming the fixed gear fishery operates in all regions and all years we tracked the release event for. The plus one is for the not-recovered event, although it is not clear to me how this is different from a zero recovery event? (ask Dan). Let \\(m\\) index a recovery event for a given release event and let \\(n_{m|k} = n_{T} \\times n_r + 1\\) where \\(n_{m|k}\\) is the number of recovery events for release event \\(k\\). Let \\(N^k_{m}\\) denote the number of tag-recoveries for a given release and recovery combination, and \\(\\boldsymbol{N^k} = (N^k_{1}, N^k_{2}, \\dots, N^k_{n_{m|k}})^T\\) represents a vector of all possible observed recoveries for release event \\(k\\). Model fitted values for \\(N^k_{m}\\) are calculated as \\[ \\widehat{N}^k_{m} = \\sum_a \\sum_s N^k_{a,r,y,s} \\frac{F^{LL}_{a,r,y,s}}{Z_{a,r,y,s}} (1 - e^{-Z_{a,r,y,s}})\\delta_y \\ \\ y,r \\in m|k \\] where, \\(N^k_{a,r,y,s}\\) is the number of tagged fish alive from tag-release event \\(k\\), and \\(\\delta_y\\) is the reporting rate in year \\(y\\). There are three likelihoods used in the literature for tag-recoveries, The Poisson (tag_likelihood = 0) \\[ N^k_{m} \\sim \\mathcal{Poisson}(\\widehat{N}^k_{m}) \\] The Negative Binomial (tag_likelihood = 1) \\[ N^k_{m} \\sim \\mathcal{NB}(\\widehat{N}^k_{m}, \\hat{\\phi}) \\] where, \\(\\hat{\\phi}\\) is the estimable dispersion parameter Multinomial (tag_likelihood = 2) \\[ \\boldsymbol{N^k} \\sim \\text{Multinomial}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\theta}}^k, \\text{Neff}^k\\right) \\] All the recovery states include all regions, and years of recoveries including the non recaptured, where, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\theta}}^k = (\\hat{\\theta}^k_1, \\hat{\\theta}^k_2\\dots, \\hat{\\theta}^k_{n_{m|k}})\\) is the proportions of all recovery states (Vincent, Brenden, and Bence 2020; Goethel, Legault, and Cadrin 2014), with \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\theta}^{k}_{m} = \\frac{\\widehat{N}^k_{m}}{\\sum_m \\widehat{N}^k_{m}} \\end{equation}\\] For recapture conditioned tag-recovery observations, we calculate the probability of capture a fish at time \\(t\\) being released in region \\(r\\) and recovered in region \\(r&#39;\\). This was explored by McGarvey and Feenstra (2002). In this study they show how many of the terms can be dropped when describing the probability of that recovery event. The term \\(S_i[a_t, a_m]\\) represents the probability of a tagged individual tagged at \\(a_t\\) surviving until \\(a_m\\). In our model this surviorship will be regional specific, i.e., fish in certain regions will be exposed to higher fishing mortality rates than other regions over time. Here, model predicted recaptures are recapture conditioned, which means the predicted proportions are year specific, and represent the proportion of recaptures in each region, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\theta}}^k_y = (\\hat{\\theta}^{k}_{y,1},\\dots, \\hat{\\theta}^k_{y,n_r})&#39;\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\theta}^{k}_{y,r} = \\frac{\\widehat{N}^k_{r,y}}{\\sum_r\\widehat{N}^k_{r,y}} \\end{equation}\\] How to deal with the high number of zeros in \\(\\boldsymbol{N^k}\\) zero inflated? These are derived for each recovery event (also year and region specific) denoted by the index \\(m\\) and tag-release event by using the age-length key that was used to release each recovered fish to obtain an sex specific age-frequency. This age-frequency is then aged by the number of years this tag-recovery event was at liberty to derive observed tag-recoveries by age and sex. This assumes the age-length conversion between releases and recoveries is consistent and allows us to use recovered fish with no length or sex recorded, but has the down side as mentioned earlier in the tag release section of smearing a single recovered fish across multiple age bins and sexes. However, it does mitigate the problem of going backwards and forwards through the age-length transition matrix, which appears to be more problematic. Multinomial (Not implemented) \\[ {N}^k_{r,y} \\sim \\text{Multinomial}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\theta}}^k_y, \\text{Neff}^k_y\\right) \\] Here, model predicted recaptures are recapture conditioned, which means the predicted proportions are year specific, and represent the proportion of recaptures in each region, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\theta}}^k_y = (\\hat{\\theta}^{k}_{y,1},\\dots, \\hat{\\theta}^k_{y,n_r})&#39;\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\theta}^{k}_{y,r} = \\frac{\\widehat{N}^k_{r,y}}{\\sum_r\\widehat{N}^k_{r,y}} \\end{equation}\\] Release conditioned are defined as the proportion of recaptures over all states denoted as \\(i\\), for each release event. All the states, include all regions, and years of recoveries including the non recaptured, where, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\theta}}^k = (\\hat{\\theta}^k_i, \\hat{\\theta}^k_2\\dots, \\hat{\\theta}^k_{n_i}) = (\\hat{\\theta}^k_{1,1}, \\hat{\\theta}^k_{1,2}, \\hat{\\theta}^k_{2,2}, \\dots, \\hat{\\theta}^k_{n_y,n_r}, \\hat{\\theta}^k_{NR})\\) is the proportions of all states (Vincent, Brenden, and Bence 2020; Goethel, Legault, and Cadrin 2014), with \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\theta}^{k}_{i} = \\frac{\\widehat{N}^k_{i}}{\\sum_i \\widehat{N}^k_{i}} \\end{equation}\\] Likelihood formulations Multinomial This likelihood has no estimable parameters \\[ \\boldsymbol{X} \\sim \\text{Multinomial}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\widehat{P}}\\right) \\] To avoid \\(\\widehat{P}_i = 0\\), in which case the multinomial can be undefined if \\(X_i = 0\\) all values of \\(\\widehat{P}_i\\) are run through a posfun function which adds a small constant and penalty to the likelihood. See this TMB issue here or Ben Bolker’s write up found here. Dirichlet-Multinomial The Dirichlet multinomial distribution used for composition data, when \\((p_1,\\dots,p_k) \\sim \\mathrm{Dirichlet}(\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_k)\\) and \\((x_1,\\dots,x_k) \\sim \\mathrm{Multinomial}(n, p_1,\\dots,p_k)\\), then \\((x_1,\\dots,x_k) \\sim \\mathrm{DirichletMultinomial(n, \\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_k)}\\). The probability density function follows \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = \\frac{\\left(n!\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\sum \\alpha_k\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(n+\\sum \\alpha_k\\right)}\\prod_{k=1}^K\\frac{\\Gamma(x_{k}+\\alpha_{k})} {\\left(x_{k}!\\right)\\Gamma(\\alpha_{k})} \\end{equation}\\] In the paper by Thorson et al. (2017), the Dirichlet multinomial with observed proportions denoted by \\(\\tilde{\\pi}\\) fitted proportions \\(\\pi\\) and over dispersion parameter \\(\\beta\\) and effective sample size \\(n_{eff}\\). This relates to the classic parametersiation above with \\(x_k = \\tilde{\\pi}_k n_{eff}\\), \\(\\alpha_k = \\beta \\pi_k\\) and \\(n = n_{eff}\\). When this likelihood is implemented it has an estimable parameter \\(\\theta = \\beta/n_{eff}\\). When simulating from this distribution we first simulate the dirichlet variable, using independent gamma draws (normalised), with shape parameter set as the fitted proportion. Then draw from the multinomial with expected composition based on the dirichlet draw. Projecting Recruitment There are two methods for future recruitment, parametric and empirical. Parametric will simulate from the the lognormal distribution with \\(\\sigma_R\\). Empirical will resample input recruitment deviations between certain years Parametric future_recruitment_type == 0 \\[ \\epsilon_y \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\sigma_R^2 \\right) \\] resulting recruitment multipliers, also termed year class strengths (\\(YCS_y\\)) are bias adjusted \\(YCS_y = \\exp(\\epsilon_y - 0.5\\sigma_R^2)\\) Empirical future_recruitment_type == 1 this will sample with replacement input recruitment deviations between the values specified in year_ndx_for_empirical_resampling. Note elements of year_ndx_for_empirical_resampling are C++ vector dimensions. If year_ndx_for_empirical_resampling = c(0,n_years - 1) this will resample from all input recruitment deviations. if year_ndx_for_empirical_resampling = c(0,9) this will resample from the first 10 input recruitment deviations. if year_ndx_for_empirical_resampling = c((n_years - 9):(n_years - 1)) this will resample from the last 10 input recruitment deviations. Deterministic recruitment future_recruitment_type == 2. This will assume \\(YCS_y = 1\\) which result in the model applying mean recruitment for all future years Fishing Fishing selectivity that was assumed in the last year of the model is used during the projection period. There are two methods users can use for future fishing, assume fishing mortality rates or catches. User specifies F values during projection (unlikely useage) future_fishing_type = 0 populate future_fishing_inputs_trwl and future_fishing_inputs_fixed with F values User specifies Catch values during projection (more likely) future_fishing_type = 1 populate future_fishing_inputs_trwl and future_fishing_inputs_fixed with future catches. An F is calculated based on the hybrid fishing mortality method, which should result in predicted catches close to these but not exact.

Length: n_years "],["contributing-to-spatialsablefishassessment.html", "Contributing to SpatialSablefishAssessment", " Contributing to SpatialSablefishAssessment This is an open source project and we encourage users to make changes and help develop the model further. Any commit to the Github page will trigger the Github actions to check the R package which includes installing it, running unit-tests and building the Gitbook which then will be publically available. Before commiting to this repository it is recommended to run all these tasks locally. The Github repository contains a R script called BuildPackage.R which contains most of the calls that are triggered by the Github actions. When editing TMB code and recompiling you need to go into the src/ directory and delete any files with the extension .dll or .o. You should also do this in the src/TMB directory. If you don’t delete these libraries sometimes the pkgbuild::compile_dll() wont recompile the source code with the updated changes. It is best to get into the habit of doing this when dealing with the TMB source code. Any model that is added, should be able to be unit-tested. For TagIntegrated model I created a mirror model called TagIntegratedValidate which has heaps more switches which I didn’t want in the production version, but needed to validate isolated functionality. Although this creates duplicate code bases I still think it is the best approach. When you do this it is recommended that you add a unit-test which checks the production and validation model are the same. This will tell you when you change functionality in one of the models and not the other, thus keeping them compatible and the unit-tests trustworthy.
