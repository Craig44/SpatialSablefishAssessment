These sections outline the elements and corresponding dimensions of both data and parameters. 3.1 data ages vector of ages. Length n_ages years vector of years from start year to current year. length n_years length_bins vector of length bin midpoints. length. n_length_bins n_projections_years integer of future years to project the model n_projyears = n_years + n_projections_years do_projection integer 0 means dont do projection 1 does a stochastic projection n_regions integer needs to be greater than 1 global_rec_devs integer 1 means all regions share the same recruitment deviations. 0 means they have separate global recruitment deviations. This will effect the dimensions of the parameter ln_rec_dev n_init_rec_devs number of initial n_age_deviations (parameter$ln_init_rec_dev) to multiply against the initial numbers at age to have non equilibrium initial age-structure. A value of zero will not apply these initial devs and expects parameter$ln_init_rec_dev to have length 1.
